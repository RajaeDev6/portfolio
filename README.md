# Rajae - Personal Portfolio

A clean and minimal portfolio website that highlights my software engineering and cybersecurity work.  
The site focuses on clarity, structure, and simple navigation while showcasing both my engineering projects and academic cybersecurity labs.

## The Process

The goal was to build a portfolio that reflects how I approach software:  
simple, functional, and intentional.

1. **Design First**  
   Planned a clean layout with clear sections and consistent spacing.  
   Prioritized readability over decoration.

2. **TailwindCSS**  
   Used Tailwind for utility-based styling and fast iteration.  
   Kept the design minimal - no custom components or heavy styling.

3. **Mobile Experience**  
   Focused heavily on mobile:
   - hamburger menu  
   - auto-closing navigation  
   - smooth scrolling  
   - clean spacing  

4. **Content Structure**  
   Split the work into:
   - About  
   - Software Projects  
   - Cybersecurity Projects  
   - Skills  
   - Certifications  
   - Contact  

   This keeps the portfolio balanced between software engineering and cybersecurity.

5. **Performance**  
   Avoided frameworks and build pipelines to keep things simple and load times extremely fast.

## 🔧 How It Can Be Improved

Some future enhancements I’m considering:

- **Small project screenshots** to visually show each project  
- **Dedicated project pages** for deeper breakdowns  
- **Add a downloadable resume button**  
- **Add a blog section** for technical writeups (Go, Linux, cyber labs, etc.)
